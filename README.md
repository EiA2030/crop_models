# Crop and agronomic models

This module contains several of the available models for modelling several of the needed elements by use cases regarding fertilizer inputs, planting dates, crop suitability and thers. These tools allow to expand and extrapolate scenario analysis. As much as possible, we will try to optimize models through several optimization at the functional level.

Tools in this module are available for use cases to adapt for their specific needs. TRANSFORM will support the calibration for specifications, re-assessing and undergoing further anaylisis into aggregation and recommendation domains to be delivered into DST.

## WOFOST
Implemntation of the WOFOST crop growth simulation model, using (for now) the [``Rwofost`` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rwofost/index.html). Certain implementations and functionality to facilitate us have been wrapped around this tool.
